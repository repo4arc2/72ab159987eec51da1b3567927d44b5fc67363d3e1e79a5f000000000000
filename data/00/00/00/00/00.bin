00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,390
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

24
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,730
真的  你怎么做到不吐的
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

25
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,280
闭嘴
Shut up.

26
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,260
伙计
Buddy!

27
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,920
你怎么想的  已达到承载上限了
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

28
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,610
走楼梯吧
Take the stairs.

29
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,700
是啊  别别
Yeah. Stop, stop.

30
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,590
交出箱子  斯塔克
Hand over the case, Stark.

31
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,560
交出来
Hand it over.

32
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,980
斯塔克
Stark?

33
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,650
呼吸
Breathe, breathe.

34
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,240
好样的  巷子里见  我去找点吃的
Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

35
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,850
不走楼梯
No stairs!

36
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,700
洛基呢
Where's Loki?

37
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,220
洛基  洛基
Loki! Loki!

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,410
我是阿斯加德的洛基
I am Loki of Asgard.

39
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,370
我肩负光荣的使命
And I am burdened with glorious purpose.

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,710
我...
I...

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,200
没事了
Never mind.

42
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,810
别碰那个
Don't touch that.

43
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,770
似乎是标准的时序违规
Appears to be a standard sequence violation.

44
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,150
时间分支进展速度和斜率稳定
Branch is growing at a stable rate and slope.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,540
时间异体已确认
Variant identified.

46
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,330
你说我什么
I beg your pardon.

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,980
代表时间变异管理局
On behalf of the Time Variance Authority,

48
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,550
我以违反神圣时间线的罪名逮捕你
I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,870
手举起来
Hands up.

50
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,000
你跟我们走
You're coming with us.

51
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,520
抱歉  "我们"是谁
I'm sorry. Who's "Us"?

52
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,210
最后机会  时间异体
Last chance, Variant.

53
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,640
今天真的很辛苦了
It's been a very long day,

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,100
我受够了全副武装的白痴
and I think I've had my fill of idiots in armored suits

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,050
对我指手画脚
telling me what to do,

56
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,590
所以  不好意思  这其实是你们最后的机会
so, if you don't mind, this is actually your last chance.

57
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,830
给我滚吧
Now get out of my way.

58
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,420
你正在以1/16的速度移动
You are now moving at 1/16th speed,

59
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,860
但却在以实际时间感受疼痛
but feeling all that pain in real time.

60
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,930
重置时间线
Reset the timeline.

61
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,610
-什么种族  -斯库鲁时间异体
- What species? - Variant Skrull.

62
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,010
这是什么地方
What is this place?

63
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,200
我爸可是高盛董事会成员
My dad is on the board of Goldman Sachs.

64
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,310
我一通电话  就让你的工作私有化
One call and your whole job is privatized.

65
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,270
-好了  -你觉得那怎么样
- All right. - How'd you like that?

66
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,240
你好  先生
Hello, sir.

67
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,490
-走了  -你在犯下大错
- Come on. - You're making a terrible mistake.

68
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,460
你犯下了大错
You're making a big mistake.

69
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,880
-你好  长官  -登记这项证物
- Hello, ma'am, uh... - Log this as evidence.

70
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,690
能至少告诉我这是什么吗
Can you at least tell me what it is?

71
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,580
是宇宙魔方  务必小心
It's the Tesseract. Be very careful with it.

72
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,180
听上去好傻
It sounds dumb.

73
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,060
告诉你
Know this.

74
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,500
你敢惹我  后果很严重
You cross me, there are deadly consequences.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,680
走着瞧吧
We'll see.

76
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,450
想都别想
Absolutely not.

77
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,220
这可是高档阿斯加德皮革
This is fine Asgardian leather.

78
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,970
别动
Hold very still.

79
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,580
等一下的
Now, hang on just a minute.

80
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,270
请签字确认这是你说过的所有的话
Please sign to verify this is everything you've ever said.

81
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,690
什么
What?

82
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,210
这个也要签
Sign this, too.

83
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,060
这太荒唐了
Oh, this is absurd.

84
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,680
还有这份
And this.

85
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,850
请确认  据你所知
Please confirm to your knowledge

86
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,610
你并非完全的机械体
that you are not a fully robotic being,

87
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,990
出生时是有机体
were born an organic creature,

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,300
并拥有在很多文化中被称为灵魂的东西
and do in fact possess what many cultures would call a soul.

89
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,060
什么  "据我所知"
What? "To my knowledge"?

90
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,270
难道有很多人不知道自己是不是机器人吗
Do a lot of people not know if they're robots?

91
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,000
感谢你的确认  请往前走
Thank you for confirming. Move through.

92
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,450
如果我真是机器人  可我不知道呢
What if I was a robot and I didn't know it?

93
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,570
机器会把你从内熔毁
The machine would melt you from the inside out.

94
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,990
请快走  先生
Please move along, sir.

95
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,860
好吧  我不是机器人  我不会有事
Okay, I'm not a robot, so I'll be fine.

96
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,410
什么
What?

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
-那是什么  -你的即刻气场
- Oh, what's that? - Your temporal aura.

98
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,940
-那是什么  -请穿过门
- What's that? - Please, through the door.

99
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,030
取号
Take a ticket.

100
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,890
这难道是熟食店吗  不要
What is this, a deli? No.

101
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,860
取号
Take a ticket.

102
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,150
这里只有我们两个
There's only two of us in here.

103
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,730
取号
Take a ticket.

104
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,090
这是个错误  我不该来这里
This is a mistake! I shouldn't be here!

105
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,700
你好  你可能在说
Hey there! You're probably saying,

106
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,600
"这是个错误  我不该来这里"
"This is a mistake. I shouldn't even be here."

107
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,030
欢迎来到时间变异管理局
Welcome to the Time Variance Authority.

108
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,450
我是分钟小姐
I'm Miss Minutes,

109
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,350
我的工作就是在你
and it's my job to catch you up

110
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,980
接受罪行审判前  让你了解情况
before you stand trial for your crimes.

111
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,640
那我们就别再浪费一分钟了
So let's not waste another minute.

112
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,800
坐好  把笔削尖  看看这个吧
Settle in, sharpen your pencils, and check this out.

113
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,240
很久以前  发生了牵涉甚广的多元宇宙战争
Long ago, there was a vast multiversal war.

114
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,950
无数独特的时间线彼此争夺优势地位
Countless unique timelines battled each other for supremacy,

115
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,970
几乎导致了万事万物的
nearly resulting in the total destruction of...

116
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,130
彻底毁灭
...well, everything.

117
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,450
但之后  全知的时间守护者出现了
But then, the all-knowing Time-Keepers emerged,

118
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,320
通过将多元宇宙重新整理为
bringing peace by reorganizing

119
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,340
单一时间线  而带来了和平
the multiverse into a single timeline,

120
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,810
也就是神圣时间线
the Sacred Timeline.

121
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,380
现在时间守护者们
Now, the Time-Keepers

122
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,070
为世上万物保护并保存
protect and preserve the proper flow of time

123
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,740
正常的时间流
for everyone and everything.

124
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,290
但有时  像你这样的人
But sometimes, people like you

125
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,100
会偏离时间守护者创建的道路
veer off the path the Time-Keepers created.

126
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,120
我们称这种人为时间异体
We call those Variants.

127
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,630
或许你发起了起义  或只是上班迟到了
Maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work.

128
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,970
不管是怎么回事  偏离道路创造了关联事件
Whatever it was, stepping off your path created a nexus event,

129
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,440
如果不加以管理  就可能疯狂分支
which, left unchecked, could branch off into madness,

130
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,700
再次导致多元宇宙战争
leading to another multiversal war.

131
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,380
但别担心
But, don't worry,

132
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,940
为了确保不会如此
to make sure that doesn't happen,

133
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,280
时间守护者创造了时管局和它了不起的员工们
the Time-Keepers created the TVA and all its incredible workers.

134
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,960
时管局已插手修复了你的错误
The TVA has stepped in to fix your mistake

135
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,360
并让时间恢复到了原本应有的道路上
and set time back on its predetermined path.

136
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,800
而你因为自己的行为
Now that your actions have

137
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,110
在时间线上无容身之地了
left you without a place on the timeline,

138
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,650
所以你必须因自己的罪行受审
you must stand trial for your offenses.

139
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,720
坐好吧  我们会让你马上面见法官
So sit tight, and we'll get you in front of a judge in no time.

140
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,700
务必拿好你的号票
Just make sure you have your ticket,

141
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,110
一旦有接待者有空就会见你
and you'll be seen by the next available attendant.

142
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,700
-时时刻刻  -永永远远
- For all time. - Always.

143
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,360
时间守护者  神圣时间线
Time-Keepers? The Sacred Timeline?

144
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,850
谁会相信这种蠢话
Who actually believes this bunkum?

145
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,530
号票  先生
Ticket, sir?

146
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,070
那人没给我号  我跟他要了
That guy didn't give me a ticket. I tried to ask for one.

147
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,110
-请出示号票  先生  -我还跟他要了
- Ticket, sir! - I tried to ask that guy for a ticket!

148
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,830
先生
Sir...

149
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,660
你还冲我吼起来了吗  蠢货
What, you're raising your voice at me, bucket head?

150
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,230
谢谢您莅临时管局
Thanks for visiting the TVA.

151
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,860
尽请对我们的服务做出评价
Don't hesitate to let us know how we're doing.

152
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,360
追踪者和时间卫队响应了一桩常规关联事件
The hunter and his Minutemen responded to a routine nexus event.

153
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,780
似乎他们到达时  遭到了伏击
It appears that when they arrived, somebody got the jump on 'em.

154
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,850
还用说
You think?

155
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,820
是他
It's him.

156
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,460
是啊  看刺伤跟其他人一致
Yeah, stab wounds look consistent with the others.

157
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,310
尸体的位置
Positioning of the bodies

158
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,750
表明他们根本没来得及反应
indicates they didn't know what the hell hit 'em.

159
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,470
重置设备也不见了
And reset charge is gone.

160
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,260
这是上周第六起袭击了
That's the sixth attack in the last week.

161
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,570
还只是据我们所知
That we know of.

162
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,080
放下武器
Wait, stand down! Stand down.

163
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,720
只是个孩子
It's just a kid.

164
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,950
喂
Hey, yo!

165
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,310
敲一下
Tap it.

166
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,150
别担心  那个魔鬼还怕我们呢
Don't worry, that devil's afraid of us.

167
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,810
我们会解决他的
We're gonna take care of him.

168
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,660
我们会让你回你该去的地方
And we're gonna put you back where you belong.

169
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,210
带礼物来的魔鬼
Devil bearing gifts.

170
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,140
检查它的时序年代
Go ahead and run this for sequence period

171
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,380
和即刻气场痕迹
and any hints of temporal aura.

172
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,800
你知道我们查不到什么的
You know we won't get anything.

173
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,940
就试试嘛
Yeah, just give it a shot.

174
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,150
时间分支接近红线了  我们得走了
The branch is nearing red line. We need to go.

175
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,060
好
Okay.

176
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,100
没事的
It's okay.

177
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,050
进行重置
Set a reset charge.

178
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,790
长官  你会想看看这个
Sir, there's something you'll wanna see.

179
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,650
下一案请上前
Next case, please.

180
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,960
劳菲森  时间异体L1130  洛基·劳菲森
Laufeyson. Variant L1130, AKA Loki Laufeyson,

181
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,100
被控时序违规7-20-89
is charged with sequence violation 7-20-89.

182
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,590
你是否认罪
How do you plead?

183
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,390
夫人  神不会恳求
Madam, a god doesn't plead.

184
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,140
这出哑剧还挺有意思
Look, this has been a very enjoyable pantomime,

185
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,690
但我现在想回家了
but I'd like to go home now.

186
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,830
你是否有罪  先生
Are you guilty or not guilty, sir?

187
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,710
我可是恶作剧之神  是的
Guilty of being the God of Mischief? Yes.

188
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,800
我是否觉得这一切无比乏味  是的
Guilty of finding all this incredibly tedious? Yes.

189
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,510
是否违反了神圣时间线
Guilty of a crime against the Sacred Timeline?

190
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,340
绝对没有  你们抓错了人
Absolutely not, you have the wrong person.

191
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,840
是吗  那我们该抓谁去
Oh, really? And who should we have?

192
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,430
我怀疑是复仇者联盟
I suspect, the Avengers.

193
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,930
我之所以能拿到宇宙魔方
You see, I only came into possession of the Tesseract

194
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,660
是因为他们穿越了时间
because they traveled through time,

195
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,340
肯定是为阻止我登天为神王
no doubt in a last-ditch effort to

196
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,350
而做出的最后一搏
stave off my ascent to God King.

197
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,580
好严重的指控
That's quite an accusation.

198
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,750
相信我  两个托尼·斯塔克的古龙水味儿好明显
Oh, believe me, you can smell the cologne of two Tony Starks.

199
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,460
你说什么时间罪犯  那你该去找他们
You speak of Time Criminals? It's they you should be after.

200
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,940
或许你可以给我指派一支特遣队  再给我些资源
Perhaps you could provide me with a taskforce and resources,

201
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,470
我可以回去  替你们除掉他们
and I could return and eliminate them for you.

202
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,370
我们要说的不是复仇者联盟
We're not here to talk about the Avengers.

203
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,470
-是吗  -对
- Oh, no? - No.

204
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,060
他们做的事本就该发生  而你的逃跑不是
What they did was supposed to happen. You escaping was not.

205
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,680
这样啊
Right.

206
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,600
"不该发生"  这谁说的
"Not supposed to happen"? According to whom?

207
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,550
时间守护者啊
The Time-Keepers?

208
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,720
时间守护者  这样啊
Oh, the Time-Keepers. Right.

209
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,620
或许我该跟这些时间守护者  神对神地谈谈
Well, perhaps I should speak to these Time-Keepers, gods to gods.

210
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,280
抱歉  但他们很忙呢
I'm sorry, but they're quite busy.

211
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,320
是吗  他们忙着干什么呢
Oh, they are? What are they doing?

212
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,360
决定正常的时间流
Dictating the proper flow of time.

213
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,120
这样啊  好吧  那你是做什么的
I see. Right. And then what do you do?

214
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,140
按照他们的决定  决定正常的时间流
Dictate the proper flow of time according to their dictations.

215
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,540
你是否认罪
How do you plead?

216
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,200
我的确
Guilty...

217
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,510
做了这个
of this.

218
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,060
-怎么回事  -等等  都别说话
- What's going on? - Hang on. Everyone quiet.

219
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,210
-他是想用他的法力  夫人  -别催我
- He's trying to use his powers, ma'am. - Don't rush me.

220
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,740
该死  怎么不好使
Damn it! Why won't it work?

221
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,780
魔法吗  那个在时管局不能用  劳菲森先生
Magic powers? They're no good in the TVA, Mr. Laufeyson.

222
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,080
本庭判你有罪  我判你被重置
The court finds you guilty, and I sentence you to be reset.

223
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,370
下一案请上前
Next case, please!

224
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,320
"重置"  那什么意思
"Reset"? What does that mean?

225
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,280
那很糟吗  那什么意思
What, is it bad? What does it mean?

226
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,240
你们这些荒唐的官僚
You ridiculous bureaucrats

227
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,500
休想决定我的故事如何结局
will not dictate how my story ends!

228
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,730
不是你的故事  劳菲森先生  从来都不是
It's not your story, Mr. Laufeyson. It never was.

229
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,610
你根本想象不到我能做什么
You have no idea what I'm capable of!

230
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,350
我可能知道
I... I think I might.

231
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,550
他能做什么
Have an idea of what he's capable of.

232
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,480
上前
Approach the bench.

233
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,730
如果你在想我认为你在想的那事  那不是好主意
If you're thinking what I think you are, it's a bad idea.

234
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,170
好吧  我只是跟着直觉走
Okay, I'm just chasing a hunch.

235
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,610
如果出了任何岔子  都怪在你头上
Anything goes sideways, it's on you.

236
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,730
好  我觉得我总在仰视你
Okay. I feel like I'm always looking up to you.

237
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,970
我喜欢  很恰当
I like it. It's appropriate.

238
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,350
你是谁
And who are you?

239
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,240
我要把这里烧成灰
I'm gonna burn this place to the ground.

240
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
我带你去我的办公桌  你从那里开始烧吧
I'll show you where my desk is, you can start there.

241
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,060
看看吧
Have a look.

242
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,620
美丽的家园
Home sweet home.

243
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,050
这里不是没有魔法吗
I thought there was no magic here.

244
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,840
是没有
There isn't.

245
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,990
那不是真的
That's not real.

246
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,410
是的  很遗憾  各种文件也是真的
It is, and, unfortunately, so is all the paperwork.

247
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,510
但可以给你点火做火绒  来吧
Good tinder for your fire, though. Come on.

248
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,780
这地方是个噩梦
This place is a nightmare.

249
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,150
那是另一个部门了
That's another department.

250
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,530
那个部门我乐意帮你烧光
Now that department I'll help you burn down.

251
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,040
对了  我是莫比乌斯特工
I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

252
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,340
你是要带我去个什么地方杀掉吗
Are you taking me somewhere to kill me?

253
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,260
不是  我才带你离开那个处境
No. That's where you just were.

254
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,100
我的带你去个地方谈谈
I'm taking you some place to talk.

255
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,000
我不喜欢谈谈
I don't like to talk.

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,780
但你喜欢撒谎  你刚刚还撒了谎
But you do like to lie, which you just did.

257
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,770
因为我们都知道  你很喜欢说话
Because we both know you love to talk.

258
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,630
说啊说啊
Talkie-talkie.

259
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,210
你在这里干多久了
How long have you been here?

260
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,310
我不知道  不好说
I don't know. It's hard to say,

261
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,960
时管局的时间流逝不一样
time passes differently here in the TVA.

262
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,780
-什么意思  -你会了解的
- What does that mean? - You'll catch up.

263
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,510
所以你是时管局勇敢尽心的员工之一吗
So, you're part of the TVA's courageous and dedicated workforce?

264
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,180
对
Yes.

265
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,000
-你们是时间守护者创造的  -对
- You were created by the Time- Keepers. - Yep.

266
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,080
-目的是保护神圣时间线  -对
- To protect the Sacred Timeline. - Correct.

267
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,320
那好笑吗
Is that funny?

268
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,800
你们的小俱乐部
The idea that your little club

269
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,630
能代表三个太空蜥蜴
decides the fate of trillions of people

270
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,670
决定浩瀚宇宙中无数人的命运
across all of existence at the behest of three space lizards,

271
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,630
是的  这很好笑
yes, it's funny.

272
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,080
这好荒唐
It's absurd.

273
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,120
不是说你不喜欢说话吗
I thought you didn't like to talk.

274
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,090
你先请
After you.

275
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,860
我要说
For the record,

276
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,730
这里感觉真像用来杀我的房间
this really does feel like a killing-me kind of a room.

277
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,970
不怎么信任人  是吧
Not big on trust, are you?

278
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,260
孩子和狗才会信任
Trust is for children and dogs.

279
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,400
你只能信任一个人
There's only one person you can trust.

280
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,450
你自己吗  我喜欢
Yourself? I like it.

281
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,150
印T恤衫吧
Slap it on a T-shirt.

282
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,310
如果时管局真的监管一切时间
If the TVA truly oversees all of time,

283
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,700
我们怎么会此前都没听说过你们
how have I never heard of you until now?

284
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,390
因为你此前不需要听说
'Cause you've never needed to.

285
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,540
你一直生活在你的既定道路里
You've always lived within your set path.

286
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,170
我是生活在我选择的道路里
I live within whatever path I choose.

287
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,970
当然了  好了  来坐吧
Sure you do. Okay, come have a seat.

288
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,480
我说了  时管局的时间运行不一样
I told you, time moves differently in the TVA.

289
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,980
来坐吧
Come on, sit down.

290
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,620
我们开始吧
Let's get into this.

291
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,600
来啊  坐吧
Go on, have a seat.

292
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,180
要是眼神能杀人
If looks could kill.

293
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,340
你想要我怎么样
What do you want from me?

294
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,390
先配合一下吧
Well, let's start with a little cooperation.

295
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,900
我不擅长
Not my forte.

296
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,960
是吗
Really?

297
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,430
哪怕是讨好你打算背叛的强者时吗
Even when you're wooing someone powerful you intend to betray?

298
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,140
得了
Come on.

299
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,650
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

300
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,990
或许我想了解呢
Maybe I'd like to learn.

301
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,170
我专门追踪危险的时间异体
I specialize in the pursuit of dangerous Variants.

302
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,710
比如我吗
Like myself?

303
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,170
不  是特别危险的时间异体
No, particularly dangerous Variants.

304
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,150
你就是个小猫咪
You're just a little pussycat.

305
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,310
我要问你一组问题
I got a set of questions for you.

306
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,850
你要诚实回答
You answer them honestly,

307
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,230
那样的话  我或许能满足你的一些愿望
and then maybe I can give you something you want.

308
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,060
你想离开这里  是吧
You wanna get out of here, right?

309
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,960
嗯  那就从这里开始
Yeah, so we'll start there.

310
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,990
如果你回去了  打算怎么做
Should you return, what are you gonna do?

311
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,310
-完成我开启的大业  -那是什么
- Finish what I started. - Which is?

312
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,120
夺取我的王位
Claim my throne.

313
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,730
你想做国王吗
You wanna be king?

314
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,790
我不是想做  我生来就是
I don't want to be, I was born to be.

315
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,600
我知道  但具体是什么的国王
I know, but king of what exactly?

316
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,310
你不会理解的
You wouldn't understand.

317
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,250
说来试试
Try me.

318
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,320
米德加德
Midgard.

319
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,760
就是地球
AKA Earth.

320
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,300
好  你成为米德加德的国王了  然后呢
All right. Now you're the king of Midgard, then what?

321
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,820
幸福永远了吗
Happily ever after?

322
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,220
阿斯加德  九大王国
Asgard, the Nine Realms.

323
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,640
-宇宙吗  -什么
- Space? - Space?

324
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,210
宇宙很大  那是不错的功绩
Space is big. That'd be a nice feather in your cap.

325
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,010
"洛基  宇宙之王"
"Loki, the King of Space."

326
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,100
你敢嘲笑我
Mock me if you dare.

327
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,630
不  我没
No, I'm not.

328
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,370
真的  我其实是你的粉丝
Honestly, I'm actually a fan. Yeah.

329
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,620
我就是在想
And I guess I'm wondering why

330
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,740
你这么有潜力的人  怎么就想做统治者
does someone with so much range just wanna rule?

331
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,450
我会让人们轻松的
I would've made it easy for them.

332
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,940
人们喜欢轻松
People like easy.

333
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,820
第一个  也是最压迫的谎言
The first and most oppressive lie ever uttered

334
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,880
就是自由之歌
was the song of freedom.

335
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,320
怎么说
How's that one go?

336
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,260
对几乎所有生灵
For nearly every living thing,

337
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,100
选择带来羞耻  不确定和后悔
choice breeds shame and uncertainty and regret.

338
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,220
每条道路上都有岔路
There's a fork in every road,

339
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,360
可人们总走错路
yet the wrong path always taken.

340
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,240
很好
Good. Yeah.

341
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,860
你说"几乎所有生灵"
You said "Nearly every living thing,"

342
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,090
那么你应该是不算在内咯
so I'm guessing you don't fall into that category?

343
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,030
时间守护者建造了惊人的奇景
The Time-Keepers have built quite the circus,

344
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,490
而且小丑也完美地扮演了自己的角色
and I see the clowns are playing their parts to perfection.

345
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,380
这么爱用比喻  我喜欢
Big metaphor guy. I love it.

346
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,190
让你听上去特别聪明
Makes you sound super smart.

347
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,140
我就是聪明
I am smart.

348
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,640
我知道
I know.

349
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,810
好
Okay.

350
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,270
好
Okay.

351
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,350
这是什么
What is this?

352
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,860
你壮举的抽样  容我来
A sampling of your greatest hits, if I may.

353
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,680
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you...

354
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,810
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

355
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,070
不用
No.

356
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,570
我记得  我当时也在  还有吗
And I remember. I was there. Anything else?

357
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,090
真有趣  生来的统治者  你输了好多次
It's funny, for someone born to rule, you sure do lose a lot.

358
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,100
甚至可以说这是你的天性
You might even say it's in your nature.

359
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,240
上一个对我说这种话的人
You know, things didn't turn out so well

360
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,390
下场可不怎么好
for the last person who said that to me.

361
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,880
嗯  菲尔·科尔森
Oh, yeah, Phil Coulson.

362
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,670
不
No!

363
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,610
复仇者联盟不是为了
Didn't the Avengers come together

364
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,540
给他复仇而团结一心  击败了你吗
to literally avenge him by defeating you?

365
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,620
对于一个死人算不上什么安慰了
Little solace to a dead man.

366
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,220
你喜欢伤人吗
Do you enjoy hurting people?

367
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,960
让他们觉得渺小
Making them feel small?

368
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,390
让他们感到恐惧
Making them feel afraid?

369
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,110
-你的游戏吓不倒我  -让他们觉得弱小
- Your games don't frighten me. - Making them feel little?

370
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,310
我知道我是什么人
I know what I am.

371
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,190
-杀人犯吗  -解放者
- A murderer? - A liberator.

372
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,330
解放了眼球吧
Of eyeballs, maybe.

373
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,110
看那笑容  你很喜欢那么做
Look at that smile. You are enjoying that.

374
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,780
你喜欢伤害他们吗
Did you enjoy hurting them?

375
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,320
我不需要玩这种游戏  我可是神
I don't have to play this game. I'm a god.

376
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,490
什么神来着  恶作剧之神吧
Of what, again? Mischief, right?

377
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,760
嗯  我可不觉得这算什么恶作剧
Yeah. I don't see anything very mischievous about this.

378
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,720
是啊  你是看不出吧
No, I don't suppose you do.

379
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,430
我们谈谈你的逃跑吧
Let's talk about your escapes.

380
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,910
你很擅长做坏事
You're really good at doing awful things,

381
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,050
然后逃掉
and then just getting away.

382
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,840
没办法  我就是个喜欢恶作剧的顽皮鬼
What can I say? I'm a mischievous scamp.

383
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,040
这是我最喜欢的之一
This is one of my favorites.

384
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,890
这里是驾驶舱  威廉·A·斯考特机长
From the flight deck, Captain William A. Scott,

385
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,530
西北东方航空305航班  按时飞往西雅图
Northwest Orient Airlines 305, on schedule to land in Seattle.

386
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,170
今天的飞行时间  约...
Flight time today, approximately...

387
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,320
波本和苏打水吗
Bourbon and soda?

388
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,160
谢谢
Thank you.

389
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,460
不客气
Absolutely.

390
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,130
还需要我为您做什么吗  先生
Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?

391
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,930
那就看看吧
I suppose we'll find out, won't we?

392
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,580
-小姐  -是  库珀先生
- Uh, Miss? - Yes, Mr. Cooper?

393
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,870
你最好看看那张字条
You might want to take a look at that note.

394
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,590
我有枚炸弹
I have a bomb.

395
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,950
我看不出这有什么关系...
I fail to see how this has any relevance or bearing on...

396
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,920
别  精彩的部分在这里
No. This is the good part.

397
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,250
改天再见了
See you again someday.

398
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,630
哥哥  海姆达尔  你们最好准备好了
Brother, Heimdall, you better be ready.

399
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,070
真不敢相信你是DB·库珀  拜托
I can't believe you were D.B. Cooper. Come on!

400
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,450
我当时还年轻  打赌输给了托尔
I was young, and I lost a bet to Thor.

401
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,550
我插手这样的人间事务时  时管局怎么不管
Where was the TVA when I was meddling with these affairs of men?

402
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,180
我们当时也在  在神圣时间线上冲浪呢
We were right there with you, just surfing that Sacred Timeline.

403
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,330
所以那就得到了时间守护者的认同吗
So that had the Time-Keepers' seal of approval, did it?

404
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,330
说起来倒不算是
Well, I wouldn't think of it

405
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,400
认同或不认同
in terms of approval and disapproval.

406
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,460
那是...
That's sort of a...

407
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,200
我们继续说逃跑吧
Let's get back to escapes...

408
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,820
以及心理问题
...and a little psychobabble.

409
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,790
你觉得你究竟在逃离什么
What is it that you think that you're really running from?

410
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,650
够了
Enough.

411
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,050
回笼子里咯
Back in your cage.

412
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,210
看  我也会玩狠的
See, I can play the heavy keys, too.

413
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,240
我站起来只是有话说
I was just standing up to make a point.

414
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:50,930
抱歉  请吧
I'm sorry, go ahead.

415
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,170
现在做就失去意义了
It won't be as meaningful now.

416
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,520
好吧  那坐着别动
Okay, well, stay seated.

417
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,130
我想做什么就做什么
I'll do what I want to do!

418
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,170
当然
Sure.

419
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,110
你到底想怎么样
What exactly is it that you want?

420
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,650
我想要你坦诚你这样做的原因
I want you to be honest about why you do what you do.

421
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,900
骗子
Liar.

422
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
我是认真的
I'm serious.

423
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,720
我只想更深入地了解
All I seek is a deeper understanding

424
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,010
可怕的恶作剧之神
of the fearsome God of Mischief.

425
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,840
洛基的动机是什么
What makes Loki tick?

426
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,560
-我知道这是什么地方  -什么地方
- I know what this place is. - What is it?

427
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,200
这是个幻象
It's an illusion.

428
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,530
是弱者
It's a cruel,

429
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,810
为了激发恐惧而精心策划的残忍诡计
elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear.

430
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,890
孤注一掷  试图掌控一切
A desperate attempt at control.

431
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,220
你们招摇卖弄
Now, you all parade about

432
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,000
仿佛你们是宇宙力量的神圣仲裁者
as if you're the divine arbiters of power in the universe.

433
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,150
-我们的确是  -才不是
- We are. - You're not.

434
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,640
我的选择是我自己的
My choices are my own.

435
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,980
你的选择是你自己的  很好  就从这儿入手
Your choice is your own. Good, let's go with that.

436
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,790
这应该能让你激动起来
I think this one's gonna fire you up.

437
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,600
自由的光鲜诱惑削减了你们人生的乐趣
The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy

438
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,380
让你们发狂地追逐权力
in a mad scramble for power...

439
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,430
确实
Precisely.

440
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,430
我本来...
I was...

441
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,460
我现在仍然快要得到我应得的一切
I am on the verge of acquiring everything I am owed,

442
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,670
如果我得到了  都是因为我的努力
and when I do, it'll be because I did it.

443
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,550
不是因为这本就该发生
Not because it was supposed to happen.

444
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,850
也不是因为你或时间变异管理局
Or because you or the Time Variance Authority,

445
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,070
或不管你们自称什么  允许我得到
or whatever it is you call yourselves, allowed me to.

446
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,290
老实说  你很可悲
Honestly, you're pathetic.

447
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,190
你无关紧要
You're an irrelevance.

448
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,100
只是一条弯路
A detour.

449
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,450
我攀登的注脚
A footnote to my ascent.

450
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,250
你说完了吗
You finished?

451
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,330
你要开始严肃对待了
You're gonna start taking things seriously.

452
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,410
如果你那时没有捡起宇宙魔方
If you hadn't picked up the Tesseract,

453
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,000
你就会被关进阿斯加德的牢房
you would have been taken to a cell on Asgard.

454
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,530
洛基
Loki.

455
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,840
你好  母亲
Hello, Mother.

456
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,360
你为我骄傲吗
Have I made you proud?

457
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,180
求求你  别让事情变得更糟
Please don't make this worse.

458
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,080
这是什么
What is this?

459
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,940
这是胡扯  又是幻术  这根本没发生过
This is nonsense, more tricks. This never even happened.

460
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,060
没发生在你身上
Not to you.

461
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,280
还没有
Not yet.

462
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,480
时管局不止知道你的过去
Look, the TVA doesn't just know your whole past,

463
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,000
我们还知道你的一生  注定要发生的一切
we know your whole life, how it's all meant to be.

464
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,600
把这看作安慰
Think of it as comforting.

465
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,580
这太荒谬了
This is absurd.

466
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,120
那我也不是你母亲吗
And am I not your mother?

467
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,330
不是
You're not.

468
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,930
你总能看透一切  却看不透自己
Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.

469
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,500
然后黑暗精灵袭击了宫殿
And then the Dark Elves attack the palace,

470
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,530
你以为你让他们去找托尔了
and you think you send them to Thor.

471
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,300
走左边的楼梯吧
You might wanna take the stairs to the left.

472
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,750
其实你把他们指向了...
But instead, you send them...

473
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,640
我绝不会告诉你
I'll never tell.

474
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,190
你把她关在哪了  她在哪里
Where do you have her? Where is she?

475
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,280
你让他们找到了她
You lead them right to her.

476
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,290
我不相信  你撒谎  这不是真的
I don't believe you. You're lying. It's not true.

477
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,710
这就是真的
It is true.

478
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,840
那才是正常的时间流
That's the proper flow of time,

479
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,980
它一次又一次发生
and it happens again and again and again

480
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,410
因为理应如此
because it's supposed to,

481
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,910
因为必须如此
because it has to.

482
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,380
-时管局确保了  -她在哪里
- The TVA makes sure of it. - Where is she?

483
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,180
不如你告诉我  你喜欢伤人吗
Now why don't you tell me, do you enjoy hurting people?

484
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,690
-我不信你  -你享受杀戮吗
- I don't believe you. - Do you enjoy killing?

485
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,200
-我要杀了你  -就像你杀了你妈妈
- I'll kill you. - What? Like you did your mother?

486
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,960
抱歉  时间扭转器只让你循环
Sorry, the Time Twister just loops you,

487
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
对椅子不起作用
not the furniture.

488
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,440
你并非生来注定为王  洛基
You weren't born to be king, Loki.

489
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,840
而是注定带来痛苦  苦难和死亡
You were born to cause pain and suffering and death.

490
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,530
现在如此  过去如此  将来也如此
That's how it is, that's how it was, that's how it will be.

491
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,420
都是为了让其他人能成就最好的自己
All so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves.

492
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,100
这是什么地方
What is this place?

493
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,320
来吧
Come on.

494
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,190
你在做什么
What are you doing?

495
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,570
我的工作  你的工作是来打断吗
My job. Is it yours to interrupt?

496
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,110
有情况
We have a situation.

497
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,880
总是有情况
There's always a situation.

498
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,600
哪都别去
Don't go anywhere.

499
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,380
正进行到精彩的地方  情绪高昂
It was just getting good. Spirited.

500
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,890
-和那个时间异体对话是个错误  -那是你的看法
- Talking to that Variant is a mistake. - That's your position.

501
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,310
-他应该被重置  -我的观点与你相反
- He should be reset! - I take the opposite...

502
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,530
你认为所有人都该被重置  我刚取得进展
You think everyone should be reset. I'm getting good stuff!

503
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,350
我们又失去了一支队伍
We lost another unit.

504
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,950
洛基  我们明天再完成  接着...
Okay, Loki, I think we can finish up tomorrow and just pick it...

505
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,440
恶作剧的顽皮鬼
Mischievous scamp.

506
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,430
可惜我不感到意外
Wish I could say I was surprised.

507
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,220
-谁让你打断了我们  -我  怪我咯
- Yeah, I wish you hadn't interrupted us. - Me? It's my fault?

508
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,040
听着  他一定没走远
Look, he can't have gotten very far.

509
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,580
分头行动  见人就删
Split up. Prune on sight.

510
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,590
不  不准删除或重置  他仍能帮我们
No, no pruning, no resetting. He can still help us!

511
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,440
我知道你
I know you.

512
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,170
你是那个带着蓝盒子的罪犯
You're that criminal with the blue box.

513
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,490
你叫什么
What's your name?

514
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,990
凯西
Casey.

515
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,870
把宇宙魔方给我  否则我把你当鱼一样开膛  凯西
Give me the Tesseract, or I'll gut you like a fish, Casey.

516
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,800
鱼是什么
What's a fish?

517
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,200
鱼是什么东西
What's a fish?

518
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,940
你怎么会不知道鱼是什么
How do you not know what a fish is?

519
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,840
我这辈子一直坐在桌子后面
I've lived my entire life behind a desk.

520
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,230
那又如何
Well, what difference does it make?

521
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,380
我想知道我面对的是什么威胁  然后再照办
I wanna know exactly what I'm being threatened with before I comply.

522
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,220
死亡  凯西  暴力的痛苦的死亡
Death, Casey. Violent, painful death.

523
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,530
好好好  我照办
Okay, okay. I comply, I comply.

524
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,480
我照办  天啊
I comply. Jeez!

525
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,660
是这个
This it?

526
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,010
什么
What?

527
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,710
无限宝石
Infinity Stones?

528
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,010
你怎么
How...

529
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,890
你怎么拿到它们的
How do you have these?

530
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,220
我们有很多
Oh, We actually get a lot of those.

531
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,790
对  有人用这些石头当镇纸
Yeah. Some of the guys use them as paperweights.

532
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,740
有些人吧
Some of 'em.

533
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,500
这是宇宙里最强大的力量吗
Is this the greatest power in the universe?

534
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,310
你差点打到我
Oh, you almost hit me!

535
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,870
太过分了
That's so messed up.

536
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,030
分头行动  搜查下面的大厅
Split up. Check the lower concourse.

537
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,240
我不原谅你
I do not forgive you.

538
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,510
我爱你们  我的儿子
I love you, my sons.

539
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,600
记住这地方
Remember this place.

540
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,320
家园
Home.

541
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,600
洛基  我曾非常看重你
Loki, I thought the world of you.

542
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,440
我以为我们能永远并肩战斗
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.

543
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,590
或许你也没那么坏  弟弟
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.

544
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,050
或许吧
Maybe not.

545
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,790
谢谢
Thank you.

546
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,670
如果你真在这里  我或许还会抱抱你
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.

547
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,860
我在这儿
I'm here.

548
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,570
不死
Undying?

549
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,880
你措辞该更小心点的
You should choose your words more carefully.

550
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,370
你
You...

551
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,990
永远不会成为
will never be...

552
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,950
神
a god.

553
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,530
什么事这么好笑
What's so funny?

554
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,260
光荣的使命
Glorious purpose.

555
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,660
停
Stop...

556
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,320
下来
It.

557
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,070
停下来
Stop it!

558
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,680
停下来
St... Stop it...

559
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,030
下来  停下来
It... Stop it...

560
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,070
停  下来  停下来
Stop... I... St... Sto... St...

561
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,480
那人一直念叨着要把我变成鱼
And this guy kept saying he was gonna turn me into a fish,

562
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,610
不知道那是什么
whatever that is,

563
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,160
然后他们出现了  删了我的推车
and then they show up and just prune my cart,

564
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,650
所以我什么都做不了
so there was nothing I could have done.

565
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,450
你在这儿啊
There you are.

566
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,760
你之前抓的那个时间异体溜走了
You know, that Variant you had got away.

567
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,140
洛基
Loki?

568
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,130
无处可逃了哦
Nowhere left to run.

569
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,320
我不能回去  对吧
I can't go back, can I?

570
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,350
不能回我的时间线
Back to my timeline.

571
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,560
我不喜欢伤害人
I don't enjoy hurting people.

572
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,300
我
I...

573
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,500
我不喜欢
I don't enjoy it.

574
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,440
我那样做也是无奈
I do it because I have to,

575
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,780
因为我当时不得不那样做
because I've had to.

576
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,790
跟我详细说说
Okay, explain that to me.

577
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,590
因为那是幻象的一部分
Because it's part of the illusion.

578
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,630
是弱者为了激发恐惧
It's the cruel, elaborate trick

579
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,620
而精心策划的残忍诡计
conjured by the weak to inspire fear.

580
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,810
孤注一掷  试图掌控一切
A desperate play for control.

581
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,460
你相当了解你自己嘛
You do know yourself.

582
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,670
一个恶棍
A villain.

583
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,570
我不这么看
That's not how I see it.

584
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,880
你想用它
You try to use that?

585
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,590
用过几次
Oh, several times.

586
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,550
就连无限宝石在这里都没用了
Even an Infinity Stone is useless here.

587
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,810
时管局如此强大
The TVA is formidable.

588
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,240
从我的经验来看  没错
That's been my experience.

589
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,630
听着  我给不了你救赎
Listen, I can't offer you salvation,

590
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,330
但我也许可以给你更好的
but maybe I can offer you something better.

591
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:34,300
一名在逃时间异体一直在杀害我们的时间卫队
A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.

592
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,710
你们需要恶作剧之神协助你们阻止他
And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?

593
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,800
没错
That's right.

594
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,630
那为什么选我
Why me?

595
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,150
我们要抓捕的时间异体是
The Variant we're hunting is...

596
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,950
你
you.

597
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,170
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

598
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,050
时间特征是3000年初
Time signature is early third millennium.

599
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,670
绝对不属于这个时代
Definitely anachronistic.

600
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:29,980
石油
Oil.

601
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,970
应该是哪个混蛋找到了一台时间机器
I think some jackass found himself a time machine,

602
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,310
回来过去  想要暴富
came back here to get rich.

603
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,280
要我们散开找他吗  长官
Should we fan out and look for him, sir?

604
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,250
不了  不值得我们写报告
Nah. It's not worth the paperwork.

605
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,020
删了它  我们撤  进行重置
Just prune it. Let's bail. Set a charge.

606
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,230
等等  那边有人
Wait. Someone's out there.

607
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,460
去看看
Check it out.

608
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:02,810
趴下
Get down!

609
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,440
谢谢您莅临时管局
Thanks for visiting the TVA.

610
